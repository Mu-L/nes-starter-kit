# Setting up your tools

You'll need a few tools to get started with NES Game development. I'll list them out, and detail what it is used for.
Make sure you have installed everything marked as **REQUIRED** before moving on to the next chapter.

## Get the code!

**REQUIRED**

First, if you haven't already done so, get a copy of this repository. You may do this either by doing a `git clone` of
this repository, or downloading it as a zip file. 

To download a zip file, go to this project's page on Github, and click the green `Clone or download` button at the top right.

You should also rename the folder from `nes-starter-kit` to the name of your game!

## Base tool zip

**REQUIRED**

To make life easier, most of the tools, including the compiler, c library, and (TODO: more?) are included in the 
following zip file: 

TODO: Make this zip!! 

Download this file, and extract it to the "tools" folder. Once you have done that, follow the steps below.

**NOTE**: _This tutorial is built entirely for Windows - while things may be compatible with other Operation Systems, I
don't want to spend extra time supporting them._

## Cygwin, make, and unix tools

**REQUIRED**

These are some tools usually available on unix-based systems for building things. We mainly need the `make` command. 
You won't use this directly at all, but it is needed to build your NES rom.

To install this, go to the tools folder, and double-click `install_cygwin.bat`. This will download and launch the installer
for cygwin. You will need to go through the entire process. Pick any url for the mirror; it does not matter.

**NOTE**: _The script isn't strictly necessary, but it selects the packages we need automatically, in addition to the defaults.
It is provided merely as a convenience. If you have cygwin installed already, make sure you have `make`, `wget` and `curl`
installed._

## FCEUX (Or another NES Emulator)

**REQUIRED**

You will need an NES emulator to test your game! I typically use FCEUX, but you are welcome to use whatever you are comfortable
with. Nintendulator is another common option.

FCEUX is available here: http://www.fceux.com/

Next double click a rom in Windows explorer, then select your emulator to open it with once. This allows
the built-in tools to open your emulator of choice easily.

First, choose the "Select a program from a list of installed programs" option:

![Step 1](./images/fceux_1.png)

Make sure the "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file" checkbox is ticked, then click browse, and find the
emulator you downloaded: 

![Step 2](./images/fceux_2.png)

(Note: On Windows 10 you have to click `more apps`, scroll down and find `look for another app on this pc` instead.) 

If you don't do this, running your rom will not work.

## Tiled

**REQUIRED**

Tiled is a tile editing tool for maps. We will be using it for designing our levels. It's similar to a paint program, but
with map tiles. Just install it for now; we will talk about it when we start editing maps.

Get it here: http://www.mapeditor.org/

## Visual Studio Code (Or other code editor)

You probably want a program to edit your code! I prefer VS Code, as it has a lot of powerful features for our use built in.

Get it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

For best results, go to `file`, then `open folder`, and point it at your game's base folder. (Where `README.MD` is located.)

Of course, you are able to use another program such as vim or notepad++ if you prefer.

### Additional VS Code Tweaks

If you like using VS Code, there are some little things you can do to make it even better. 

#### Set built-in terminal to cygwin

If you have installed cygwin with the built-in script, this should just work. 

If you used a 32 bit cygwin, or did not install it in the default directory, you will have to tweak things slightly. 
Open `nes-starter-kit/.vscode/settings.json`, and change the setting `terminal.integrated.shell.windows` to wherever you 
installed cygwin.

#### Compile and run on pressing f6

This is already set up for you too! You can change how this works by editing `nes-starter-kit/.vscode/tasks.json`.

#### Error highlighting

TODO: Is this easy enough? I seem to recall doing it before

### Personal notes and junk 
TODO: Remove these

TODO: Build the zip...
Stuff to put in zip: 
- cc65 (original version)
- neslib + famitracker
- wget script
- nesst?
- size tool?
- what else?
