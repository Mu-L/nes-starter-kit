# Playing your Game

Okay, so you've set up your tools, you've built the game, and you've started it in the emulator. How do you play it?

The controls are pretty straightforward. 
`Start` will start the game, as well as pause.
The `Directional pad` is used to select things in menus, and also move in-game.
The `A` button is used to confirm things in menus.
The `B` button is used to cancel things in menus.

To start the game, you can either run the `make run` command, or double-click the `.nes` file in the `rom/` folder.

TODO: Once we have a bit more of a game, include story details or something?
